# WComm

Wireless Communication final project - Digital Audio Wireless Transmission System

#Objective

Design and evaluate experimentally a system for the wireless digital transmission of audio in real time.

#Design specifications

1. System operation frequency and power as allowed
by Colombian law.

2. Channel bandwidth: 10kHz maximum (Out-of-Band Emission (OOBE) with Power Spectral Density (PSD) 25dB below maximum in the adjacent 1.1 Project Proposal channels, 50 dB elsewhere).

3. Digital modulation.

4. Real-time operation (maximum delay, 5 sec) with audio captured from PC mic connector and played back at PC speakers.

5. Link range ≥ 7 meters.

6. Intelligible voice transmission for Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) ≤ 15dB.

7. Silence detection at the transmitter with null transmission and synthetic background noise generation at the receiver during silent periods.

8. Audio quality is to be optimized subject to the constraints above.
